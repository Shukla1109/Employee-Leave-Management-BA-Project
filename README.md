Project Type
Business Analysis Case Study (Non-Technical / No Coding)

Prepared By
Himanshu Shukla

# Project Overview

This case study demonstrates the end-to-end Business Analysis lifecycle for designing an Employee Leave & Attendance Management System.
The project focuses on business requirements, process mapping, Agile documentation, and UAT, similar to real IT implementation projects.

The system aims to eliminate the current manual leave tracking process (emails & Excel) and replace it with a centralized portal for employees, managers, HR, and payroll operations.

# Business Objectives

✔ Automate leave request & approval workflow
✔ Reduce manual HR workload and errors
✔ Provide real-time leave balance visibility
✔ Improve compliance through audit trails
✔ Enable accurate monthly attendance reports for payroll

# High-Level Workflow
AS-IS (Current Manual System)

Employee applies via email or message

Manager replies when available

HR updates Excel manually

Payroll verifies reports at month-end

Pain points: delays, no visibility, no audit trail, high manual workload

TO-BE (Proposed System)

Employee applies leave through portal

System validates & routes approval

Manager approves/rejects digitally

Leave balance & attendance sync automatically

HR generates monthly automated reports

# Improvement: 
Faster workflows, 60% less HR effort, full visibility
