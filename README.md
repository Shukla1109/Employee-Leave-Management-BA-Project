# Employee Leave & Attendance Management System – Business Analysis Case Study

Project Type
Business Analysis Case Study (Non-Technical / No Coding)

Prepared By
Himanshu Shukla

📍 Project Overview

This case study demonstrates the end-to-end Business Analysis lifecycle for designing an Employee Leave & Attendance Management System.
The project focuses on business requirements, process mapping, Agile documentation, and UAT, similar to real IT implementation projects.

The system aims to eliminate the current manual leave tracking process (emails & Excel) and replace it with a centralized portal for employees, managers, HR, and payroll operations.

🎯 Business Objectives

✔ Automate leave request & approval workflow
✔ Reduce manual HR workload and errors
✔ Provide real-time leave balance visibility
✔ Improve compliance through audit trails
✔ Enable accurate monthly attendance reports for payroll

🧠 Deliverables Included in this Repository
Document	Description
01_BRD.pdf	Business Requirements Document
02_UserStories.pdf	15 User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
03_BPMN_AsIs.pdf	AS-IS manual leave process
04_BPMN_ToBe.pdf	TO-BE automated workflow
05_MoSCoW.pdf	Prioritization of requirements using MoSCoW framework
06_UAT_TestCases.pdf	10+ UAT scenarios mapped to User Stories
07_Sprint_Backlog.pdf	3-Sprint Agile delivery plan

All documents replicate real SDLC documentation used by Business Analysts in IT projects.

🔍 High-Level Workflow
AS-IS (Current Manual System)

Employee applies via email or message

Manager replies when available

HR updates Excel manually

Payroll verifies reports at month-end

📌 Pain points: delays, no visibility, no audit trail, high manual workload

TO-BE (Proposed System)

Employee applies leave through portal

System validates & routes approval

Manager approves/rejects digitally

Leave balance & attendance sync automatically

HR generates monthly automated reports

📌 Improvement: Faster workflows, 60% less HR effort, full visibility

💡 Why this project is valuable for BA / Product / Functional roles

This project shows hands-on experience with:

Requirement elicitation & documentation

Translating business needs into system behavior

Collaborative workflow design in Agile teams

Business process improvement thinking

Validating solutions through UAT

No datasets or coding are used — this is a pure BA project like those in real IT delivery teams.
